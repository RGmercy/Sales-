Sales Analysis Project: Optimizing Revenue, Market Trends &amp; Customer Insights

This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover key trends in customer behavior, market performance, and revenue growth. By leveraging advanced data analytics tools, I examined customer purchasing patterns, identified high-value segments, and assessed retention rates to enhance customer relationship strategies.

Through market analysis, I evaluated sales performance across different regions, product categories, and promotional campaigns, providing data-driven recommendations to optimize marketing efforts. Additionally, revenue analysis highlighted growth opportunities, pricing strategies, and sales forecasting to support business decision-making.

This project showcases my ability to transform raw sales data into actionable insights that drive profitability and customer engagement.
